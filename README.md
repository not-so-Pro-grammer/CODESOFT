# To-Do List Application

## Overview

The To-Do List application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library, allowing users to create, view, and remove tasks from their to-do list.

## Features

- **View To-Do List**: Displays all the tasks the user adds.
- **Add Task**: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
- **Remove Task**: Enables the user to remove a selected task from the list.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you must install Python on your machine. The application uses the Tkinter library, which is included with standard Python distributions.

## Usage

1. **Start the application** by running the `todo_list.py` file.
2. **Add a task**:
   - Enter the task description in the input field.
   - Click the "Add Task" button.
3. **View tasks**:
   - All tasks will be displayed in the listbox.
4. **Remove a task**:
   - Select the task from the listbox.
   - Click the "Remove Task" button.

## Code Explanation

The application is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Tkinter is used for creating the GUI.
2. **Class Definition**: The `TodoApp` class is defined to encapsulate all the functionality of the to-do list application.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the main window, frames, listbox, scrollbar, entry widget, and buttons.
4. **Adding Tasks**: The `add_task` method adds a new task to the list and updates the listbox.
5. **Removing Tasks**: The `remove_task` method removes the selected task from the list and updates the listbox.
6. **Updating Listbox**: The `update_listbox` method refreshes the listbox to display the current tasks.

## Example Code

Here's a snippet of the main components of the application:


## Conclusion

The To-Do List application is a practical project for beginners to learn about GUI development in Python. It demonstrates creating, managing, and organizing tasks using a simple graphical interface.
