# To-Do List Application

## Overview

The To-Do List application is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library, allowing users to create, view, and remove tasks from their to-do list.

## Features

- **View To-Do List**: Displays all the tasks the user adds.
- **Add Task**: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
- **Remove Task**: Enables the user to remove a selected task from the list.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you must install Python on your machine. The application uses the Tkinter library, which is included with standard Python distributions.

## Usage

1. **Start the application** by running the `todo_list.py` file.
2. **Add a task**:
   - Enter the task description in the input field.
   - Click the "Add Task" button.
3. **View tasks**:
   - All tasks will be displayed in the listbox.
4. **Remove a task**:
   - Select the task from the listbox.
   - Click the "Remove Task" button.

## Code Explanation

The application is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Tkinter is used for creating the GUI.
2. **Class Definition**: The `TodoApp` class is defined to encapsulate all the functionality of the to-do list application.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the main window, frames, listbox, scrollbar, entry widget, and buttons.
4. **Adding Tasks**: The `add_task` method adds a new task to the list and updates the listbox.
5. **Removing Tasks**: The `remove_task` method removes the selected task from the list and updates the listbox.
6. **Updating Listbox**: The `update_listbox` method refreshes the listbox to display the current tasks.

## Conclusion

The To-Do List application is a practical project for beginners to learn about GUI development in Python. It demonstrates creating, managing, and organizing tasks using a simple graphical interface.

# Calculator

## Overview
This is a simple GUI-based Calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Clear button to reset the input
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)


### Usage
1. Run the calculator application:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
2. The calculator window will appear. Use the buttons to perform calculations.

## Code Explanation
- The `click` function handles button clicks and updates the display.
- The `root` is the main window of the application.
- The `frame` organizes the layout of the buttons and display.
- Each button is created using the `tk.Button` widget and associated with the `click` event.


## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by basic calculator applications and serves as a learning tool for GUI development with Tkinter.

# Password Generator

## Overview
This is a GUI-based Password Generator application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to generate strong, random passwords of specified length and copy them to the clipboard.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Generates strong and random passwords
- Allows specification of password length
- Copy generated password to clipboard

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- pyperclip (for clipboard functionality)


### Usage
1. Run the password generator application:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```
2. The password generator window will appear. Enter the desired password length and click "Generate Password". Use the "Copy Password" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## Code Explanation
- The `generate_password` function generates a random password based on the specified length.
- The `copy_password` function copies the generated password to the clipboard.
- The `root` is the main window of the application.
- The `frame` organizes the layout of the input field, buttons, and display.
- Various widgets like `tk.Label`, `tk.Entry`, and `tk.Button` are used to create the GUI components.


## Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by common password generator tools and serves as a learning tool for GUI development with Tkinter.
